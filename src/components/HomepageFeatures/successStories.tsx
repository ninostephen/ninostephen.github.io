        My favorite thing about working with Nino is that he helps speed up my work by successfully completing assigned tasks
        without requiring much rework or oversight. <strong> Of all the contract resources I’ve worked with at <span className="redacted">[Redacted Company Name]</span> over the past year, he as been my favorite</strong> due to his ability to write clear and concise <span className="redacted">[Redacted Tool Name]</span> logic, suggesting he has better mastery of the software than other contractors. <strong>I find myself constantly wanting to create work for Nino to complete, unlike other resources who often required more time and effort to guide and redo their work than if I did the work.</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        I also appreciate how responsive and timely Nino has been in responding to feedback. He also communicates very well
        which helps when discussing complex topics.
        <br />
        <br />

        <strong>I almost find Nino to be an extension of me at times in that I can create basic requirements the night before and he will have them implemented the next day, a true partnership that has been beneficial to my work product.</strong>

        <strong>Nino is not afraid to take on new areas of responsibility despite having little or no knowledge of it.</strong> He would reach out to me daily even when I was unable to give him some assignments since I was still in the discovery phase. This is a huge strength since there are other contractors that I have worked with that took advantage of this
        slump in a negative manner.
        <br />
        <br />
        During the last 2 weeks, I was finally able to get some data that could be <span className="redacted">[Redacted Action Name]</span> in a <span className="redacted">[Redacted Tool Name]</span> and with little explanation, Nino took the challenge and was able to produce something meaningful and we have been tweaking it ever since.
        <br />
        <br />
        <em>Opportunities for growth</em>:
        Continue on this trajectory of technical competency and keep up the “forthrightness”.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>I would certainly commend him for other future engagements.</strong>

        I would like to recognize Nino's invaluable contribution to the <span className="redacted">[Redacted Company Name]</span> Security Operations Center(SOC) engagement <strong>despite being the latest addition to the team for the <span className="redacted">[Redacted Work Name]</span> workstream, he and <span className="redacted">[Redacted Colleague Name]</span> has delivered beyond client expectations</strong> with the <span className="redacted">[Redacted Task Name]</span> deliverables assigned to the team. The team has been consistently receiving Client commendations due to always being a step ahead of the tasks as per the defined scope and timeline. Nino had worked hand in hand, not just internally with us <span className="redacted">[Redacted Company Name]</span> but more crucially with the Client to provide innovative solutions that ultimately streamlined to how we craft <span className="redacted">[Redacted Task Name]</span> that are highly relevant and timely to <span className="redacted">[Redacted Company Name]</span> especially in the BISL and TISL community.
        <br />

        We have recently just concluded our account celebration and the team had garnered Exceptional Client Service - Quality
        Excellence award.
        <br />

        Keep up the great work, @Nino Stephen Mathew!
